        <h1>Discover Our Pregnancy Studies<br><span></span></h1>

          improve product safety information and help parents-to-be and <br>

        <h1>COVID-19 Updates<br><span></span></h1>
        <p>Our MotherToBaby experts have issued updates to our educational <br>
          resources on COVID-19 during pregnancy and breastfeeding. <br>
          COVID-19 has had a significant impact on pregnancy, <br>
          increasing the risk of hospitalization, preterm birth, <br>
          and transmission to the baby. Limited access to prenatal <br>
          care and potential mental health impacts are also concerns. <br>
          Preventive measures and discussions with healthcare providers <br>
          can help mitigate these risks.</p>

        <h1>Go for weekly check-ups<br><span></span></h1>
        <p>It's very normal to feel more anxious than usual during pregnancy. <br>
          Worry and fear are natural responses to big changes, including expecting <br>
          a child. Whether this is your first baby or you're adding to your family, <br>
          your life is about to change dramatically in ways you can't control. </p>

        <p>An anxiety disorder during pregnancy, however, can interfere with your <br>
          ability to live your day-to-day life. Especially during this time, it <br>
          can be difficult to distinguish between normal worry and persistent anxiety.

        <h1>Inclusion for All<br><span></span></h1>
        <p>Pregamate welcomes all individuals and families at all stages of their pregnancy <br>
          and lactation journey and recognizes that not all people identify as “men” or “women.” <br>
          We strive to use gender-neutral language when talking about pregnancy and lactation. <br>
          By using inclusive and non-gendered terminology, we strive to enable all families to <br>
          be empowered to reach their personal and familial pregnancy and lactation goals.</p>

        <p>While our name still contains a reference to “mothers”, we have updated our website <br>
          and resources to use more inclusive terms where possible and where doing so allows <br>
          the overall message to remain clear to the general population. We welcome feedback <br>
          on any of the terms used and acknowledge that our understanding of these terms will <br>
          evolve over time and is always better informed by open dialogue.</p>
