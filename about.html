            <h1>About Prega Health<br><span></span></h1>
            <p>Prega Health a service of the non-profit Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS), <br>
                is the nation’s leading authority and most trusted source of evidence-based information on the benefit <br>
                or risk of medications and other exposures during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. We specialize in <br>
                answering questions about the benefit/risk of exposures, such as medications, vaccines, chemicals, herbal <br>
                products, substances of abuse, maternal health conditions and much more, during pregnancy or breastfeeding. <br>
                Our no-cost information service is available to people who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding, their family <br>
                members, health professionals, and the general public via chat, text, phone, and email in both English and Spanish.</p>


            <p>Prega Health is a suggested resource by many agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <br>
                and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Women’s Health. More than 100,000 people and their health providers <br>
                seek information about birth defects prevention from OTIS and MotherToBaby every year.</p>
                
            <p>We also conduct state-of-the-art observational research on the safety of medications and vaccines in pregnancy. <br>
                9 out of 10 people who are pregnant in the United States take medication but evidence on the safety of many <br>
                medications during pregnancy is often lacking. Our observational MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies aim to <br>
                provide this much-needed information so people who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding and their health <br>
                providers can make more informed treatment decisions.</p>
                
            <p>Prega Health welcomes all individuals and families at all stages of their pregnancy and lactation journey. <br>
                We strive to use inclusive and person-centered language when talking about pregnancy and lactation. By using <br>
                inclusive and person-centered terminology, we hope to enable all families to be empowered to reach their personal <br>
                and familial pregnancy and lactation goals. While our name still contains a reference to mothers, we are updating <br>
                our resources with more inclusive terms. Use of the term mother or maternal refers to a person who is pregnant. <br>
                Use of the term father or paternal refers to a person who contributes sperm. We welcome feedback on any of the terms <br>
                used and acknowledge that our understanding of these terms will evolve over time and is always better informed by open dialogue.</p>
